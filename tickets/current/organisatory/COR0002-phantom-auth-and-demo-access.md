# Coordination COR0002: Phantom authentication and demo access

- Status: In progress
- Created: 2026-09-19
- Last updated: 2026-09-25
- Milestone: M0 identity / M2 wallet prerequisite
- Converted from: Retired `DEV0016`
- Tracked development tickets: completed [DEV0038 — Phantom Supabase Web3 authentication](../../archive/backend/DEV0038-phantom-supabase-web3-authentication.md), completed [DEV0039 — Prepared identity and wallet bindings](../../archive/backend/DEV0039-prepared-identity-and-wallet-bindings.md), completed [DEV0040 — Protected access and database context](../../archive/backend/DEV0040-protected-access-and-database-context.md), and [DEV0041 — Club wallet authorization](../backend/DEV0041-club-wallet-authorization.md)
- Related records: depends on completed [DEV0015 — Supabase database foundation](../../archive/backend/DEV0015-supabase-database-foundation.md), [DEV0025 — Next.js backend boundary](../../archive/backend/DEV0025-nextjs-backend-boundary.md), and [DEV0027 — Phantom wallet connection foundation](../../archive/blockchain/DEV0027-phantom-wallet-connection-foundation.md); enables [COR0006 — Persistent membership catalogue](COR0006-persistent-access-catalogue.md) and [COR0007 — Core multi-gym membership MVP](COR0007-core-multigym-membership-mvp.md); completed [DEV0046 — Email OTP registration and application profiles](../../archive/backend/DEV0046-email-otp-registration-and-application-profiles.md) independently replaced the personal entry path under COR0003; cancelled [DEV0037 — Phantom embedded-wallet onboarding](../../archive/blockchain/DEV0037-phantom-embedded-wallet-onboarding.md) is historical optional work

## Objective and boundaries

Coordinate the replacement of the implicit Anna preview persona with verified MovX Club identities backed by prepared Phantom wallets and Supabase Auth. Wallet connection, Sign-In With Solana, application identity/run enrollment, protected data access and club-wallet authority remain separate security boundaries even when the interface presents a continuous flow.

This record preserves the complete planning intent of retired DEV0016 while assigning each implementation boundary to one small peer development ticket. It does not authorize source, dependency, configuration, migration or test changes and is never used in a commit subject.

The coordinated result implements the specification's [roles and fixtures](../../../docs/mvp-spec.md#5-roles-screens-and-fixtures), public-access rule C17, social rule C19, and identity/wallet boundaries C12/C14. It does not implement payments, token balances, transaction submission, embedded wallets or a general organization-admin interface.

Every former DEV0016 implementation concern has one owner. Cross-ticket integration validation remains in this coordination record; fixes found during integration return to the ticket that owns the affected behavior or receive a new peer DEV ticket if they are genuinely new scope.

## Other relationships

- Completed DEV0015 supplies `auth.users`, profiles, runs, dataset participation, organizations/roles and default-deny database foundations; it does not own the new Auth/identity repositories or policies.
- Completed DEV0025 supplies server-only/import enforcement; each direct ticket must preserve its service/repository direction.
- Completed DEV0027 supplies the normalized Phantom Wallet Standard account and signer but grants no application authority.
- COR0006's catalogue tickets and COR0007's membership tickets are downstream consumers of the DEV0038–DEV0040 identity/access sequence. They own their feature persistence and operations rather than authentication.
- DEV0023 consumes the same verified access context later. Cancelled DEV0018 is historical; neither is a direct COR0002 member.
- DEV0037 was cancelled as optional post-MVP work. Any future embedded Phantom onboarding requires a new ticket with current provider evidence and does not affect this extension-first sequence.
- Completed [DEV0051 — Club value proposition and sign-in entry](../../archive/frontend/DEV0051-club-value-proposition-and-sign-in-entry.md) is a downstream, independent frontend consumer. It owns the public club explanation and dedicated club-facing entrance, not authorization.
- Financial and on-chain tickets may later consume DEV0041's club-authority result; DEV0041 itself signs no transaction and verifies no payment.

## Delivery sequence and completion conditions

1. Deliver DEV0038 first and prove one real Phantom message-signature login, session reload and sign-out through local Supabase Auth. Connection-only state must remain visibly unauthenticated.
2. Deliver DEV0039 against the proven Auth subject/session shape. Use private server configuration to atomically and idempotently enroll only the prepared Anna profile from the verified wallet, without a second Phantom prompt. Preserve the durable binding when the user disconnects while blocking live wallet-required actions until the same wallet reconnects.
3. Deliver DEV0040 after verified enrollment exists. Apply authorization and row-level security to protected server paths while retaining anonymous access to the supported public catalogue and details. Challenge catalogue access was the historical target when DEV0040 shipped and is superseded by DEV0058.
4. Deliver DEV0041 after DEV0046 supplies account-first administrator sessions and DEV0047 completes the shared one-time wallet-challenge contract. DEV0041 extends that contract for a club wallet, which remains different from any personal wallet. The administrator signs in individually through the existing email identity and then enters a club workspace; no shared club credential or second Auth user exists. Nonfinancial COR0006 catalogue work may start after DEV0046 without waiting for DEV0041, but club financial flows cannot.
5. Complete this coordination only when every direct DEV ticket is Completed or explicitly Cancelled/replaced, their reciprocal `Coordination` fields agree with this work map, and the integrated flow passes local database replay, distinct-wallet/replay/cross-run denial, desktop/mobile browser regression, lint, typecheck and production build.

DEV0040 and DEV0046 are complete. On 2026-09-21 the user prioritized account-first identity before DEV0041 and the catalogue work later converted from DEV0017 to COR0006, then accepted email OTP, open registration, optional one-wallet linking, email-protected replacement and a local reset/cutover. DEV0047's implementation and automated evidence now exist; its real Phantom evidence remains. On 2026-09-22 the user chose to start DEV0041 against that validated contract while deferring both real-wallet rehearsals. COR0002 stays open for DEV0041 club authority. Hosted Supabase project selection is not required for local development; hosted region/plan and production origin configuration remain later operational decisions.

## Progress and integration record

The original DEV0016 was created on 2026-09-19 as a broad follow-up to the database plan. It accumulated Supabase Web3 Auth, replay-resistant enrollment, identity repositories, SQL authorization context, route guards, personal/organization bindings, provider abuse controls and browser integration. No Auth source, dependency, configuration, database migration, application session, implementation evidence or commit was created under DEV0016.

On 2026-09-20, the browser connection boundary had already been split into completed DEV0027. The authentication plan briefly changed to embedded-first Phantom Connect, then returned to the prepared extension when Phantom Portal paused new developer sign-ups. DEV0037 preserved that idea until the 2026-09-25 active-work audit cancelled it as unnecessary for the focused MVP.

Pre-implementation review on 2026-09-20 found that the remaining plan still contained four independently reviewable security boundaries. In accordance with the repository's flat workflow, DEV0016 was retired and converted to COR0002. Fresh DEV0038–DEV0041 now own the implementation. The split changes no product behavior or accepted security rule.

DEV0038 completed on 2026-09-20. The local Solana Web3 provider and cookie-based verified session path are running, the application adapter uses DEV0027's one Wallet Standard account, automated/configuration/browser checks pass, and the corrected prepared-Phantom flow passed approval, reload, cancellation, account-switch/disconnect and local sign-out without a transaction prompt.

On 2026-09-21, the user selected Anna Klein for the first prepared personal wallet and chose to reuse DEV0038's verified Supabase wallet proof for personal enrollment. DEV0039 will not request a second Phantom signature. Explicit wallet disconnect remains available and preserves the durable personal binding and Supabase session while disabling live wallet-required actions. Because the organization wallet is a different signer, DEV0041 now owns the fresh one-time application challenge.

On 2026-09-22, the user clarified that the financial organizations are fitness and sports clubs rather than generic companies. DEV0041 adopted `club wallet` and `club workspace` as user-facing language while retaining `organization` internally. Clubs receive a dedicated sign-in interface but no shared credentials or separate authentication identity: each administrator uses their personal email account and remains accountable while acting for a prepared club. Independent DEV0051 owns the public value proposition and club-facing entrance.

DEV0039 moved to In progress on 2026-09-21 after locking its `wallet_bindings` matrix, narrow default-deny database function boundary, server-only roster shape, no-body identity endpoints, rollback behavior and disconnect/reconnect validation contract.

DEV0039 completed on 2026-09-21. The shared binding migration, server-derived Anna enrollment, restricted repository/API boundary, durable disconnect UI and local runtime-login setup passed automated validation. The user then confirmed one Supabase login prompt followed by Anna enrollment without a second Phantom prompt, reload persistence, disconnect with the Anna session preserved and successful same-wallet reconnect. A read-only check found exactly one active Anna binding for one Auth subject. DEV0040 is unblocked.

DEV0040 moved to Ready on 2026-09-21 after locking its verified-actor shape, five transaction-local database settings, live validation predicate, three-table read-only policy matrix, `/api/auth/actor` response, public/private route matrix, safe-return rules, cache/invalidation behavior and exact preview-versus-database mode decision. Its review also clarified that dataset participation is not a gym membership, Proxy refresh is not authorization, configured failures never fall back to fixtures and a Supabase session must complete actor revalidation before returning to a protected page.

DEV0040 implementation started on 2026-09-21 against those locked contracts.

DEV0040's migration, server actor/context boundary, current-actor API, route guards, safe return handling and browser invalidation passed fresh migration replay, 63 SQL assertions, schema lint, 9 driver tests, 44 unit/boundary tests, configured build/guest checks and the full configuration-free desktop/mobile regression suite. Its final configured authenticated rehearsal is recorded below.

The user completed that configured authenticated rehearsal on 2026-09-21 after the UI compatibility correction and reported the prescribed flow worked. The bounded actor state, protected navigation, sign-out denial and disconnect-preserved non-wallet access all passed, so DEV0040 completed and moved to the archive. Independent DEV0046 later replaced the personal entry path with email accounts and completed under COR0003; DEV0041 is now in progress against DEV0047's automated contract while the real Phantom evidence remains deferred.

DEV0041 now has a replayable session-bound club-authority migration, bounded server/API contracts, explicit personal-versus-club wallet UI, global disconnect/account-change invalidation, local preparation tooling and automated coverage. Clean local replay, 86 SQL assertions, 13 repository tests, 45 unit/boundary tests, two hosted-config builds, a local-config build, 6 desktop/mobile regressions and the generated-signer Chrome rehearsal passed. The ticket remains In progress because the prepared real Phantom proof/disconnect/account-switch rehearsal is intentionally deferred; COR0002 therefore remains open.

## Validation results

- **Conversion eligibility — passed:** retired DEV0016 contained planning only; no implementation file, validation evidence or commit used that ID.
- **Ownership review — passed:** the direct-work map assigns provider authentication, prepared identity/bindings, protected database access and club-wallet authority exactly once; downstream public-entry and application-data tickets remain separate.
- **Dependency review — passed:** completed DEV0015/DEV0025/DEV0027 satisfy DEV0038's start conditions; DEV0039 consumed the delivered Auth contract, DEV0040 consumed the personal binding contract, and DEV0041 uses completed account-first Auth plus DEV0047's automatically validated challenge contract while real-wallet evidence remains a completion requirement.
- **Record/index validation — historical pass:** the DEV0040 snapshot contained 42 unique indexed DEV/COR records with lifecycle-correct placement. Later DEV0046–DEV0048/COR0003 planning and cleanup supersede the old “next ID” note; their current validation is recorded in DEV0048.
- **Reciprocal coordination and links — passed at DEV0040 completion:** all DEV records had valid coordination metadata, DEV0038–DEV0041 linked back to this record, and the reciprocal work map resolved. Later repository-wide validation is recorded by the owning later ticket.
- **2026-09-21 enrollment/disconnect planning consistency — passed:** DEV0039, DEV0040, DEV0041, this coordination map and the MVP specification agree that personal enrollment reuses the verified Supabase wallet without a second prompt, durable personal binding survives provider disconnect, and DEV0041 owns the fresh organization-wallet challenge. Focused Markdown formatting, repository-relative link and whitespace checks passed; no application implementation check was applicable to this planning update.
- **DEV0041 automated integration — passed on 2026-09-22:** club authority is derived from the individual email actor, exact Supabase session, active primary-admin membership and distinct prepared club binding; the database and local generated-signer Chrome rehearsal reject wrong context, tampering and replay and expose no transaction operation. Real Phantom observation remains the explicit completion gap.
- **2026-09-22 club terminology and login boundary — passed:** DEV0041, downstream DEV0051, this coordination map, README and the MVP specification agree that clubs use dedicated workspaces and wallets while administrators authenticate individually through the shared email identity. The repository-local validator resolved 752 links across 70 Markdown files and found 48 unique indexed records; focused Prettier and whitespace checks passed. No runtime implementation changed.
- **DEV0039 automated implementation evidence — passed:** two clean database replays, 43 pgTAP checks, 8 real-driver checks including concurrent enrollment, 40 unit/boundary/configuration checks, schema lint, application lint/typecheck/format, webpack production build and 34 desktop/mobile Playwright checks passed.
- **DEV0039 real-wallet integration evidence — passed:** the user confirmed the one-prompt enrollment, Anna identity, reload, disconnect-preserved session and same-wallet reconnect flow; the database contained one active Anna binding for one subject. The completed owning ticket records the full evidence.
- **DEV0039 completion/archive integrity — passed:** the repository validator found 38 unique records with valid lifecycle placement and index paths; all 600 repository-local links resolved across the 58 Markdown files in the DEV0039 commit snapshot.
- **Formatting/diff checks — passed for affected current documentation:** Prettier accepted README, the MVP specification and all ticket records; `git diff --check` passed. A broader `**/*.md` check also includes untouched historical `docs/archive/2026-09-18/implementation-plan.md`, which has a pre-existing formatting mismatch and was not rewritten by this planning change.
- **Implementation checks — not applicable:** this coordination conversion changes planning records only. Each direct DEV ticket owns its application and database validation.
- **DEV0038 integration evidence — passed:** the completed ticket records 36/36 focused tests, lint, typecheck, formatting, configuration-free and configured browser/build checks, healthy local Auth services and a real Phantom approval/reload/cancellation/account-switch/sign-out rehearsal.
- **DEV0040 automated implementation evidence — passed:** fresh migrations and seed, 63 pgTAP assertions, schema lint, 9 one-connection driver tests, 44 unit/boundary tests, lint, typecheck, formatting, configured production build, 4 configured guest desktop/mobile checks and 40 configuration-free desktop/mobile regressions passed. Its owning record contains the exact commands, failure corrections and criterion mapping.
- **DEV0040 authenticated integration evidence — passed:** the user confirmed the bounded authorized actor response, protected-page entry, sign-out denial and disconnect-preserved non-wallet actor access in the configured prepared-wallet flow.

## Risks, limitations, and follow-ups

Supabase Web3 Auth compatibility with the installed Solana Kit wallet signer is proven by completed DEV0038. Provider proof authenticates a wallet only; DEV0039 combines it with private server configuration and database constraints rather than browser-selected profile/run data. Club-wallet switching must preserve the personal administrator session while changing only separately proved club authority.

Extension-first onboarding adds a setup step and does not support ordinary mobile browsers. A future embedded-wallet project would need a new ticket after Portal access, provider terms and migration/account-linking behavior are reviewed.
