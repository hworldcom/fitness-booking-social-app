# Coordination COR0004: Hosted staging deployment

## Objective and boundaries

Coordinate the first reproducible hosted staging environment for MovX Club at `https://staging.movx.club`: a Cloudflare Worker capable of running the current Next.js application, a dedicated non-production Supabase project, and an end-to-end deployment and smoke-test record.

This coordination record does not implement runtime behavior. It separates repository/runtime compatibility, hosted database and authentication setup, and release/domain operations so that each has its own security boundary and validation evidence. It does not authorize production deployment, production data, real funds, Solana mainnet use, or completion claims for unfinished product features.

## Direct development work

| Implementation part                  | Development ticket                                                                                                        | Owned deliverable                                                                                                       | Start condition or dependency                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloudflare runtime compatibility     | [DEV0054 — Cloudflare Workers runtime foundation](../../archive/backend/DEV0054-cloudflare-workers-runtime-foundation.md) | Reviewed vinext/Workers dependencies, configuration, scripts and local compatibility validation without deploying       | Completed after the supported-host Worker smoke                                                                                           |
| Hosted data and identity environment | [DEV0055 — Hosted Supabase staging environment](../backend/DEV0055-hosted-supabase-staging-environment.md)                | Dedicated staging project, reviewed schema/runtime role, Auth/SMTP/origin controls and secret-safe operating record     | May proceed in parallel with DEV0054; requires access to the selected Supabase project and mail service                                   |
| Integrated staging release           | [DEV0056 — Staging release and domain rehearsal](../backend/DEV0056-staging-release-and-domain-rehearsal.md)              | Staging Worker, runtime/build variables, `staging.movx.club`, preserved Porkbun mail DNS and hosted smoke-test evidence | Starts after DEV0054 completes and DEV0055 passes its database/runtime/Auth/SMTP foundation; remaining DEV0055 browser evidence runs here |

All required implementation parts have a direct development ticket. These tickets are peers; DEV0056 depends on the outputs of DEV0054 and DEV0055 rather than nesting under either ticket.

## Other relationships

- DEV0015 is the historical schema, migration and least-privilege runtime-role baseline. DEV0055 deploys that contract to a hosted non-production project; it does not rewrite DEV0015.
- DEV0046 supplies the email one-time-passcode (OTP) application flow that hosted Auth must support.
- DEV0047 is a downstream hosted wallet-linking rehearsal when completed. It does not block deploying and testing the currently committed account flow.
- DEV0053 is the separately committed interface baseline at `7038f2e`. Deployment tickets must preserve it and keep their implementation/commit evidence separate.
- Cloudflare, Supabase, Porkbun DNS/email and the chosen Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service are external dependencies. Their credentials and private values must never be recorded in tickets or committed files.

## Delivery sequence and completion conditions

1. DEV0054 reviews the initializer output, proves the application builds for Workers and preserves the existing Next.js workflow.
2. DEV0055 independently creates and verifies a staging-only Supabase database/Auth environment with least-privilege runtime access.
3. DEV0056 combines completed DEV0054 runtime work with DEV0055's verified hosted foundation, deploys to `workers.dev` first, then transfers authoritative DNS safely, binds `staging.movx.club` behind the access boundary and performs the hosted rehearsal. That rehearsal supplies DEV0055's remaining browser-secret and two-account evidence.

COR0004 completes only when all three direct tickets are Completed or explicitly Cancelled/replaced, no required deliverable is left ownerless, and the integrated hosted validation proves the expected public, authentication, protected-profile and failure paths without exposing secrets or disrupting `hello@movx.club` mail.

## Progress and integration record

- 2026-09-23: Split the staging initiative before further implementation because runtime adaptation, hosted identity/data setup and external release operations have different rollback and validation boundaries.
- 2026-09-23: The user ran the vinext initializer before this coordination record was created. Its uncommitted output is assigned to DEV0054 for review; it is not accepted evidence merely because it was generated.
- 2026-09-23: DEV0053 completed independently as commit `7038f2e`; the remaining deployment diff is no longer mixed with that feature implementation.
- 2026-09-23: Adopted `staging.movx.club` as the staging hostname. Cloudflare Workers is the application origin; Cloudflare should create its custom-domain DNS record and certificate after `movx.club` is an active Cloudflare zone.
- 2026-09-23: DEV0054 now produces a complete Workers bundle, but its required local request smoke is blocked because Cloudflare `workerd` requires macOS 13.5+ and the current host reports 13.1. Continue that validation on a supported macOS or Linux host before DEV0056 begins.
- 2026-09-23: The validation host was upgraded to macOS 27.0, removing DEV0054's `workerd` host-version blocker. Local Worker request validation has resumed before DEV0056 begins.
- 2026-09-23: DEV0054 completed after the rebuilt Worker served representative public, protected, API and image requests and passed focused desktop/mobile Chrome smokes on macOS 27.0. DEV0056 may consume this runtime after DEV0055 completes.
- 2026-09-23: DEV0055 linked the dedicated Frankfurt staging project, applied and linted all seven reviewed migrations, verified the password-bound least-privilege runtime login through the transaction pooler, and validated the MovX Club six-digit-code template through custom SMTP. The two-account rehearsal remains in progress.
- 2026-09-23: With user approval, DEV0056 began before DEV0055 completion because the exact-origin browser deployment is required to finish DEV0055's browser-secret, access-boundary and two-account evidence. This does not weaken the release gates: the Worker must pass on `workers.dev`, mail DNS must be copied and verified, and Cloudflare Access must protect the custom hostname before public staging use.

## Validation results

Pending. Validate link symmetry, direct-ticket statuses and the final cross-provider rehearsal after the three development tickets record their own evidence.

## Risks, limitations, and follow-ups

- The vinext adapter is beta and may expose Next.js compatibility gaps. DEV0054 must test this application rather than relying on the compatibility scan alone.
- Moving authoritative nameservers without first copying Porkbun mail records can interrupt `hello@movx.club`; DEV0056 treats preserved MX, SPF, DKIM and DMARC records as a release gate.
- Hosted OTP must not be exposed publicly with Supabase's demonstration sender or unreviewed abuse controls. DEV0055 owns the safe staging boundary.
- Staging is not production readiness. Backups, production billing/availability, production secrets, release automation and production-domain cutover remain later work.
