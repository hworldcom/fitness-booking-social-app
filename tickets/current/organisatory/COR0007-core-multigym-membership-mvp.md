## Objective and boundaries

Coordinate the smallest coherent MovX Club product: a member chooses four participating gyms, activates Basic or Classic for one period, uses verified included check-ins, and can buy an eligible member-priced visit at another participating gym. Gyms see scoped operational evidence and a transparent provisional usage allocation. Members may follow one another and explicitly share verified check-ins.

Membership transfers, transfer fees, standalone passes/resale, ordinary or sponsored events, challenges and reactions are not part of this coordination outcome. Final gym payouts, production billing/renewal, refund law, taxes and commercial partner onboarding also remain outside the hackathon implementation until their economics are confirmed.

This record coordinates peer development work; it does not authorize implementation by itself. Each runtime or documentation change belongs to the direct DEV ticket listed below. COR0006 supplies the participating-gym and plan catalogue as a dependency rather than a nested workstream.

Every required uncreated row needs a fresh DEV ticket linked back to COR0007 before implementation begins. Cross-cutting tickets select one primary area and own their complete vertical boundary rather than duplicating work in multiple records.

## Other relationships

- [COR0006](COR0006-persistent-access-catalogue.md) is a dependency. It owns versioned plan and participating-gym catalogue persistence/services, not membership ownership, payment, usage or settlement.
- COR0003 and its identity/wallet tickets provide verified actors and optional personal-wallet ownership; they do not create a membership.
- DEV0041 provides separate gym-wallet authority; it does not prove an activation, visit or payout.
- DEV0055/DEV0056 provide hosted staging infrastructure and release rehearsal. Deployment remains a separate decision after integrated validation.
- Cancelled DEV0018 preserves the old pass-oriented reservation plan. The new membership check-in peer must use the current plan and daily rules without inheriting pass ownership/resale behavior.
- Archived DEV0058/DEV0066/DEV0068 describe superseded product contracts and are historical baselines only.

## Delivery sequence and completion conditions

DEV0069 and DEV0070 freeze the current target and initial demo economics. DEV0072 removed the obsolete product surfaces, and DEV0073 then delivered the public explanation plus the €15 non-core amendment. DEV0074 now owns typed preview discovery. DEV0075 follows DEV0074 and uses the completed DEV0073 terminology to demonstrate the four-gym selection as a browser-local draft that stops before payment or activation.

COR0006 can deliver the participating-gym and versioned-plan persistence in parallel with the preview work, provided its later service integration replaces DEV0074's adapter instead of duplicating the discovery presentation. Real membership activation depends on that persistent catalogue plus the applicable account/wallet boundaries. The preview setup cannot claim working access until activation and reconciliation exist.

Included check-ins and the gym operational view follow an active membership period. The direct non-core visit may proceed in parallel once active-period eligibility and gym-wallet destinations are stable. DEV0023 begins only after a verified check-in source exists. Final integration joins these paths on hosted staging.

Complete COR0007 only when every direct row has a DEV ticket that is Completed or explicitly Cancelled/replaced, the definition of done and A01–A24 in the specification pass, removed products have no current controls or promises, and the end-to-end Devnet demonstration persists and reconciles across reloads. Provisional allocation must remain visibly distinct from claimable payout.

## Progress and integration record

- 2026-09-25: The product was narrowed to one multi-gym membership after the user removed four-gym contract transfer as unnecessary MVP complexity, retained minimal social and removed passes plus ordinary/sponsored events.
- 2026-09-25: DEV0069 completed the specification and planning-record reconciliation. Runtime work has not started under this coordination record.
- 2026-09-25: DEV0070 raised the working Basic/Classic prices to €80/€150 and raised Basic's included allowance from eight to ten; all remain configurable demo hypotheses.
- 2026-09-26: DEV0073 raised the illustrative non-core member visit from €8 to €15, completed the responsive Home/How it works public story and passed 45 unit tests, two production build paths and 14 focused desktop/mobile browser checks. The value remains configurable and is not a production market claim.
- 2026-09-26: DEV0076 refined Home to “Your gyms. One membership.” and “A membership built around your routine.” without changing the exact-four rule. It passed 45 unit tests, the Webpack production build and focused desktop/mobile browser coverage.
- 2026-09-25: DEV0072–DEV0075 split the frontend-first delivery into legacy removal, public story, preview discovery and preview membership selection. DEV0072 and DEV0073 are complete, DEV0074 is ready and DEV0075 remains blocked on DEV0074. None claims persistent membership or payment behavior.
- 2026-09-25: DEV0072 removed the obsolete route/code/state families, migrated preview storage to follows only, passed 45 unit tests and 30 focused desktop/mobile browser checks, and completed both Webpack and vinext production builds.

## Validation results

Work-map, reciprocal-link and status validation is part of DEV0069. Each direct implementation ticket owns its detailed tests and evidence. Final integration must exercise the complete Basic path, Classic daily rule, non-core payment, gym-scoped operations, privacy, retry/recovery and mobile/desktop keyboard flows against persistent staged data.

## Risks, limitations, and follow-ups

The business model is intentionally provisional. Four gyms and the illustrative €80/€150/€15 values need interviews and modelling. Classic high-frequency use may lower effective gym compensation. Pool scope, unused value, refunds, reserves, taxes and final payout remain unresolved and must not be hidden behind a polished allocation UI.

Four runtime direct tickets have not yet been created: membership activation, included check-ins/allocation, non-core payment and gym operations. Their absence blocks implementation of those rows but does not block the sequenced frontend preview, catalogue, identity or wallet work.
